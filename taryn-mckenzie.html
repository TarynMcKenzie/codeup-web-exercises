        <h5>About Taryn</h5>
        <p>With a Bachelor of Arts in Digital Media from Savannah College of Art and Design that focuses on Interactive
            Design, Taryn has dedicated herself to designing beautifully responsive websites backed by marketing
            strategies that work for you.</p>

        <p>She began her career in the United States Marine Corps as a Combat Videographer. Her service afforded her
            numerous opportunities to not only film our nation's warriors at work, but to also design graphic artwork
            for commands aboard Marine Corps Base Hawaii.</p>

        <p>Her dedication to serving others has extended beyond her military service—reaching out to those seeking brand
            and web design in the San Antonio, Texas area.</p>

        <p>Here at Taryn Designs Online, Taryn is committed to creating digital marketing strategies and web designs for
            her clients. She excels at seeing the ‘bigger picture’, developing creative design solutions, and
            thoughtfully applying critiques to her work.</p>

        <p>Taryn has recently claimed Texas as her home, with her Marine Corps veteran husband Noah, her daughter
            Stella, Doggo Sally, and dwarf Lionshead rabbit Sir Charles Barkley. She can often be found in the garden
            caring for her plant progenies.</p>
